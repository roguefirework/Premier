# Bind
This is an overview of the individual plays that we are going to run. You must watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2WAdesflbk) as it goes over everything we are going to run. This will just go over a general overview of each individual play we are going to run. These will just be summaries and will not go in depth into what everyone's doing exactly. These summaries are mostly just to refresh everyone's minds and allow you to get a very basic understanding of what everyone else is doing.

## Defense
In general we need to be cognizant to not over rotate, I suggest you re-watch [this segment](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=218) as it contains very important information regarding rotations as well as basic defense stuff. 

All of the defensive plays we are going to run will have a name that summarizes them as remembering what "D1" means is kinda hard.
### D1: "Sage Skye B"
![D1 setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/resources/D1.png)
* [General overview here](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=297)
* This is a pretty simple A strong side setup 
* Viper walls off the entrance to hookah and garden
	* Viper also places an orb on top of box
* Skye flashes out into lobby
	* If they push Skye they can flash long and peak
	* You can also send the bird/dog through tp
* Sage is holding hookah and is ready to wall off the entrance.
	* Ideally you can sit on top of your wall
	* If you get lots of presence you can slow orb it
* Raze and Brimstone have a lot of different options
	* They can both fight for showers
	* They also can play more passively
	* Brimstone is going to be the first one to rotate
		* He can use his stim beacon to get to b faster
		* When he gets there he can use his smokes
### D2: "Showers trap"
![D2 setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/resources/D2.png)
* [General overview here](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=518)
* This is a more interesting play. The basic goal of this play is to trap showers
* Viper walls through tp and places her smoke in hookah
	* She will be passively holding this for most of the round
 *  Brimstone will smoke off the entrance into long as the round starts
 * Then Skye or Brimstone will tuck themselves into the corner by tp
	 * If they come long you can double swing and fight them, viper might rotate over
 * On the other side Raze is jiggle peeking showers and Sage is holding the sight
	 * If Sage sees people Raze and Sage should just push into showers and play for retake
	 * If Raze sees someone the actual play comes into effect
 * Raze and Sage get ready to pinch showers. Viper puts wall up, Skye flashes out through tp Viper puts wall up Skye and Brimstone TP and pinch people in showers.
	 * If things go quiet we can send one or two people back towards B
### D3: "Shower Wall"
![D3 setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/resources/D3.png)
* [General Overview](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=747)
* This setup is a variation on D2
* The viper is walling through tp and placing there orb in hookah
* Brim will smoke on top of box and hold from u hall 
* When the round starts the viper will put up the wall and sage and raze
