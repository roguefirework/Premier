This is an overview of the individual plays that we are going to run. You must watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2WAdesflbk) as it goes over everything we are going to run. This will just go over a general overview of each individual play we are going to run. These will just be summaries and will not go in depth into what everyone's doing exactly. These summaries are mostly just to refresh everyone's minds and allow you to get a very basic understanding of what everyone else is doing.

## Defense
In general we need to be cognizant to not over rotate, I suggest you re-watch [this segment](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=218) as it contains very important information regarding rotations as well as basic defense stuff. 

All of the defensive plays we are going to run will have a name that summarizes them as remembering what "D1" means is kinda hard.
### Retakes/Flanks
I would suggest that you re-watch [this segment](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=1405) as it goes over it considerably better than I can and it isn't that long.
Retakes on this map are pretty hard, if you don't control lanes to site so if you need to retreat try to retreat to one of the lanes so you can control it. If you don't control a lane you may need to flank, however it will often depend on the other team comp.
### D1: "Sage Skye B"
![D1 setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/resources/D1.png)
* [General overview here](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=297)
* This is a pretty simple A strong side setup 
* Viper walls off the entrance to hookah and garden
	* Viper also places an orb on top of box
* Skye flashes out into lobby
	* If they push Skye they can flash long and peak
	* You can also send the bird/dog through tp
* Sage is holding hookah and is ready to wall off the entrance.
	* Ideally you can sit on top of your wall
	* If you get lots of presence you can slow orb it
* Raze and Brimstone have a lot of different options
	* They can both fight for showers
	* They also can play more passively
	* Brimstone is going to be the first one to rotate
		* He can use his stim beacon to get to b faster
		* When he gets there he can use his smokes
### D2: "Showers trap"
![D2 setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/resources/D2.png)
* [General overview here](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=518)
* We should be confident about retake before running this play (Raze Ult etc.)
* This is a more interesting play. The basic goal of this play is to trap showers
* Viper walls through tp and places her smoke in hookah
	* She will be passively holding this for most of the round
 *  Brimstone will smoke off the entrance into long as the round starts
 * Then Skye or Brimstone will tuck themselves into the corner by tp
	 * If they come long you can double swing and fight them, viper might rotate over
 * On the other side Raze is jiggle peeking showers and Sage is holding the sight
	 * If Sage sees people Raze and Sage should just push into showers and play for retake
	 * If Raze sees someone the actual play comes into effect
 * Raze and Sage get ready to pinch showers. Viper puts wall up, Skye flashes out through tp Viper puts wall up Skye and Brimstone TP and pinch people in showers.
	 * If things go quiet we can send one or two people back towards B
### D3: "Shower Wall"
![D3 setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/resources/D3.png)
* [General Overview](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=747)
* This setup is a variation on D2
* The Viper is walling through tp and placing there orb in hookah
* Brimstone will smoke on top of box and hold from u hall 
* When the round starts the Viper will put up the wall and Sage and Raze will run into showers
	* Sage will do a wall in showers and someone will grab orb, be careful and make sure the wall blocks line of sight
* When the wall is up Raze and Sage can watch main from site and Brimstone can rotate if there is little presence
### D4: "B Short Trap"
![D4 setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/resources/D4.png)
* [General Overview](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=841)
* Should be confident about retake
* Viper walls across short and main and places a one-way on showers
* Brimstone will smoke of B long
* Skye will flash/dog short maybe use a boom-bot to get information about main
* Goal is to pinch on people entering hookah
* If there is presence B skye can flash through tp and Sage and Brimstone can swing, and Raze and Skye can go through the teleporter
### D5 "Strong B"
![D5 setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/resources/D5.png)
* [General Overview](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=1031)
* Viper will do a wall for shower and place orb on box
* Sage can wall and go for orb or just hold.
	* Sage and Viper will just hold showers, and play retake if they come down main
* Raze will hold hookah
* Brimstone will smoke long and Skye will flash out onto fountain
	* They can play aggressively long or they can fall off if there are a lot of people going long
### D6 "Mid death rush"
![D6 setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/resources/D6.png)
* [General Overview](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=1182)
* Probably do this on an eco, if we have a Raze ult this play is even better
* Viper does wall through tp, Brimstone smokes off Short from Fountain
* Sage should be sitting by the barrier and should immediately wall off Short from Link
* Then Skye/Raze will use util to clear and attack mid while Viper and Brimstone push
* If the Skye dog sees someone and we have raze ult, we can potentially use it
* We will have no information about shower and long so after this play we probably want to try to regroup on both sites. If spike drops we can probably try to hold it.
### D7 "Viper ult on B"
![D7 setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/resources/D7.png)
* [General Overview](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=1373)
* This play comes out of D3 and will be played as if it is D3
## Offense
#### Postplants
In the postplant we need to be aware of flanks and we can potentially play for lineups
If spike is planted on A, coming out of showers late can be powerful.
You can also sit on top of bench for a little bit and watch spawn for A
#### Don't get Pinched
If the tp goes of on either side the person who is nearby needs to come out and help out if they get pinched.
### Defaults
#### Default #1 "A Long default"
![Default 1 setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/resources/Default1.png)
* [General Overview](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=1643)
* Viper walls across short and uses a lineup for the entrance to u-hall
* Brimstone is holding shower
* Sage is watching hookah and supporting Raze and Skye
* Skye will flash long
	* If it sees someone
		* Viper will do a lineup for garden
		* After it lands Skye will dog up and Raze will scale up with it
	* If it sees no-one Raze and Skye will push up
#### Default #2 "Showers Default"
![Default 2 setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/resources/Default2.png)
* [General Overview](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=2073)
* Sage and Brimstone are watching Hookah and Long respectively
* Viper does the right side A setup
* Skye flashes out into showers quickly followed by
* Raze double satchels into showers (I got distracted by trying this and managed to get it after like 5 minutes [I have never played raze before btw])
#### Default #3 "Hookah Default"
![Default 3 setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/resources/Default3.png)
* [General Overview](https://youtu.be/q2WAdesflbk?t=2147)
* Brimstone is watching showers, Viper is watching Short
* Sage potentially start by spamming the box to discourage early aggression
* Sage then can walk up into the corner of B short and watch towards Long/Fountain
* Raze then boom-bots into Hookah and Skye flashes it
	* If the boom bot sees some Raze can nade them, otherwise just through your nade deeper into hookah
### Executes
Honestly just re-watch [this section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2WAdesflbk&t=747s) I can't quickly explain it.
