# Haven
### Lobby
[Watch this section](https://youtu.be/syPPyPdnDXY?t=73)
A Lobby is very important as one person can hold basically all of A and can leave 4 people on B and C.
## Defense
Given that defensive plays are somewhat hard to remember and we are not at a level were we need fifty different plays we will have 4. Two standard ones, a pistol/eco one, and one were we rush without skill. Hopefully this will allow us to focus on mastering a few defensive plays instead of having us be meh at a bunch of plays that most people don't remember. It will also help us hopefully learn and gain a better understanding on the retakes on this map
### D1: Standard Lobby Play
![Defensive Play 1](https://github.com/roguefirework/Premier/blob/main/haven/resources/DefensivePlay1.png?raw=true)
* [Watch this](https://youtu.be/syPPyPdnDXY?t=315)
* This setup has the main goal of taking A lobby
* At the start of the round Breach will stun into lobby
* Sova will do a lineup for lobby
* This play has two subplays, an aggressive one and a passive one. We should call weather we are playing passively or aggressively before the round starts
	* If we decide to play aggressively omen will smoke off lobby from spawn and Jett and Sova will push up
		* If we are being aggressive and the dart scans a large quantity of people obviously you should fall off and play more passively/for retake
	* If we instead decide to play passively we will keep Jett jiggle peaking or holding long/lobby and sova will rotate off into a b-hold
* On the other side of the map killjoy will do a setup to try to gain control of garage with an alarm bot either mid or long. Killjoy will place her turret either in garage and play off of it from the top of garage
* Omen will be holding long.
* If Jett has an OP we will probably just play passively 
### D3: Standard Very Weak A
![Defensive Play 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/haven/resources/DefensivePlay2.png)
* [This play is somewhat multi-faceted so please please please watch this section](https://youtu.be/syPPyPdnDXY?t=664)
* Sova will start the round with the same dart as D1.
	* In this setup Sova will probably just be playing for information and holding a passively. You need to make sure you fall off towards the outside of A if you think there is more than one person heading towards A
* This setup revolves a lot around Jett and were people are playing will depend on were Jett is playing
	* If we have Jett playing on top-site B you will be setup as described in the image, Breach towards B playing off the Jett, Killjoy holding garage and Omen holding long
	* If we have Jett on C we can have Killjoy and Breach towards B and Omen playing in garage
### D2: Pistol Round Play
![Defensive Pistol Round](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/haven/resources/HavenPistolDeffense.png)
* [Watch this](https://youtu.be/syPPyPdnDXY?t=601)
* This is going to probably be a Pistol Round/Eco Round play
* Our goal is to take control of A Lobby as a team as the round starts
* This round starts with the standard Sova dart
* Breach will stun lobby and Omen will smoke it.
* Jett and Sova will push up through main and Breach and Omen will push up through sewer.
* If we hear the people running away or something we will just follow them as a team.
* Killjoy is basically just passively controlling the rest of the map and relaying any information they get.
### D6: No Skill Rush Mid
![No Skill Rush](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/haven/resources/HavenPistolDeffense.png)
* [Watch this](https://youtu.be/syPPyPdnDXY?t=924)
* We will probably run this play if we have Sova ult and hopefully a Killjoy Ult for retake
* Killjoy will do a standard setup, maybe with a kill setup towards C
* Killjoy and Omen will push out of garage with an Omen blind. maybe also with an Omen smoke too
* Breach will use the aftershock towards window and Sova will throw a dart
* Jett will dash up and try to get some kills then quickly fall.
* After this play finishes we will probably head towards a setup similar to D1 or D3
### Rotations
Spawn rotation is pretty long but we need to be careful when we rotate through B
### Ultimates
#### Omen
Just use your ult mostly for a fast rotate.
#### Jett
Use them instead of buying. It's pretty simple
#### Sova
We will probably run the Sova ult play
#### Breach
Just ult the whole site on retakes
#### Killjoy
Do the Killjoy ult for retakes.
### Retakes
#### A
* Breach should just use their stun so it covers default and corner or from heaven down into main
	* If your up top you can flash/aftershock into hell
* Sova will just do the op dart lineup that scans the entire site
#### C
* Sova should do the crazy dart
* If we don't have garage we can use the Breach flash
* Breach can also use an aftershock that goes through the default plant and can aftershock the box on the back of the map
## Offense
### A Default
![A default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roguefirework/Premier/main/haven/resources/ADefault.png)
* [Watch this](https://youtu.be/syPPyPdnDXY?t=1393)
* This default has the goal of taking the square which is very important.
* Sova will dart either sewer or long.
	* The long dart gives us a lot of information
* If the dart sees someone breach should probably try to stun them
* Omen is just vibing near c and watching for any defender aggression. You can also smoke A long if you think there is an OP there
* Killjoy will have an Alarmbot in the window and a Killjoy turret on top of the hay bale
* If we get control towards A we should probably just setup some crossfires
* If we decide to do an A execute we can have Sova drone down sewer
#### Main ideas
* We have gained control of A main.
	* We have a few options
	* We can do a B-hit or a C-Split
	* We can also go towards a A Hit
	* If we do a A hit we can put the Killjoy turret to watch flank
### Mid Default
