### Lobby
[Watch this section](https://youtu.be/syPPyPdnDXY?t=73)
A Lobby is very important as one person can hold basically all of A and can leave 4 people on B and C.
## Defense
Given that defensive plays are somewhat hard to remember and we are not at a level were we need fifty different plays we will have 4. Two standard ones, a pistol/eco one, and a one we can play if we have retake Ults. Hopefully this will allow us to focus on mastering a few defensive plays instead of having us be meh at a bunch of plays that most people don't remember. It will also help us hopefully learn and gain a better understanding on the retakes on this map
### D1: Standard Lobby Play
![Defensive Play 1](https://github.com/roguefirework/Premier/blob/main/haven/resources/DefensivePlay1.png?raw=true)
* [Watch this](https://youtu.be/syPPyPdnDXY?t=315)
* This setup has the main goal of taking A lobby
* At the start of the round Breach will stun into lobby
* Sova will do a lineup for lobby
* This play has two subplays, an aggressive one and a passive one. We should call weather we are playing passively or aggressively before the round starts
	* If we decide to play aggressively omen will smoke off lobby from spawn and Jett and Sova will push up
		* If we are being aggressive and the dart scans a large quantity of people obviously you should fall off and play more passively/for retake
	* If we instead decide to play passively we will keep Jett jiggle peaking or holding long/lobby and sova will rotate off into a b-hold
* On the other side of the map killjoy will do a setup to try to gain control of garage with an alarm bot either mid or long. Killjoy will place her turret either in garage and play off of it from the top of garage
* Omen will be holding long.
* If Jett has an OP we will probably just play passively 
### D3: Standard Very Weak A
